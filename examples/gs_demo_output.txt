SUMMARY
============================================================

This simulation demonstrates how the GS report findings
can be verified using market data. Key observations:

1. Earnings moves are indeed larger than non-earnings moves
2. The ratio typically falls in the 2-3x range
3. There's usually a slight positive bias on earnings days
4. Options strategies depend heavily on realized volatility
